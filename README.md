## Assignments & Course Project

### Homework Assignments

There will be 5 homework assignments designed to cover core NLP concepts, including:

• Text processing and regular expressions  
• Language modeling and classification  
• Neural networks and embeddings  
• Transformer models and applications  
• Advanced NLP techniques  

📌 **Late Policy**: Homeworks cannot be turned in late unless an extension is granted at least 24 hours before the submission deadline.

📌 **Homework Drop**: The lowest homework score will be dropped at the end of the semester.

### Research Paper Presentations

Each student must present one research paper on a core NLP topic. Presentations should be 15-20 minutes followed by 5-10 minutes of discussion.

📌 **Paper Selection**: Students must select papers from a provided list or get approval for alternative papers by Week 3.

📌 **Presentation Requirements**:
• Clear explanation of the research problem
• Methodology and key contributions
• Critical analysis and limitations
• Relevance to course topics

### Paper Summaries

An important aspect of doing cutting-edge AI engineering and problem solving is being able to read papers. Particularly now more than ever, developments in the science are required to envision solutions to engineering challenges in AI.

Each student is expected to read assigned research papers before their presentation and submit a paragraph summary addressing the following questions:

📌 **Summary Requirements**:
• What is most interesting in the paper?
• What could the paper have done better in either how it's written or the research itself?
• What questions do you have from what you read in the paper?

📌 **Submission**: Submit one paragraph (150-250 words) for each assigned paper before the presentation date.

📌 **Purpose**: Develop critical reading skills and prepare for meaningful discussion during paper presentations.

📌 **Assignments**: See [Paper Summaries Directory](paper-summaries/README.md) for specific assignments and submission guidelines.
