def add_ngram_features(texts: List[str], n: int = 2) -> Dict[str, int]:
    """
    Build vocabulary including n-gram features alongside unigrams.
    
    N-grams are sequences of n consecutive words that capture local context
    and word relationships that single words miss. For example:
    - "not good" (bigram) has different meaning than "not" + "good" separately
    - "very good movie" (trigram) provides richer context than individual words
    
    Args:
        texts (List[str]): List of text strings
        n (int): Maximum n-gram size (1=unigrams, 2=bigrams, 3=trigrams, etc.)
    
    Returns:
        Dict[str, int]: Combined vocabulary with unigrams + n-grams, sorted alphabetically
    
    Examples:
        >>> add_ngram_features(["good movie", "bad movie"], n=2)
        {'bad': 0, 'bad movie': 1, 'good': 2, 'good movie': 3, 'movie': 4}
        
        >>> add_ngram_features(["not good"], n=2) 
        {'good': 0, 'not': 1, 'not good': 2}
    
    Implementation Notes:
        - Include all n-grams from 1 to n (unigrams, bigrams, trigrams, etc.)
        - Use extract_bag_of_words for preprocessing individual texts
        - Create n-grams by sliding window over word sequences
        - Combine all features and sort alphabetically for consistent ordering
        - Handle edge cases (empty texts, n=1, texts shorter than n)
    """

def compute_tf_idf_features(texts: List[str], vocab: Dict[str, int]) -> List[List[float]]:
    """
    Convert texts to TF-IDF weighted feature vectors.
    
    TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency) weights words by:
    - TF: How often a word appears in a document (local importance)
    - IDF: How rare a word is across all documents (global importance)
    
    This gives higher weight to words that are frequent in a document but
    rare across the corpus, which are typically more informative.
    
    Args:
        texts (List[str]): List of text strings to convert
        vocab (Dict[str, int]): Vocabulary mapping words to indices
    
    Returns:
        List[List[float]]: List of TF-IDF vectors, one per text
    
    Examples:
        >>> vocab = {"good": 0, "movie": 1, "bad": 2}
        >>> texts = ["good movie", "bad movie movie"]
        >>> compute_tf_idf_features(texts, vocab)
        [[0.693, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.693]]  # Simplified example
    
    Formulas:
        TF(word, doc) = count(word in doc) / total_words_in_doc
        IDF(word) = log(total_docs / docs_containing_word)
        TF-IDF(word, doc) = TF(word, doc) * IDF(word)
    
    Implementation Notes:
        - Use extract_bag_of_words for word counting
        - Calculate TF for each word in each document
        - Calculate IDF for each word across all documents
        - Multiply TF * IDF for final weights
        - Handle edge cases (empty documents, zero counts)
        - Use natural logarithm (math.log)

def extract_feature_statistics(texts: List[str]) -> List[Dict[str, float]]:
    """
    Extract statistical features from texts for machine learning.
    
    Beyond word counts, statistical features capture document-level
    properties that can be highly predictive:
    - Length features: Short vs. long reviews have different patterns
    - Lexical diversity: Vocabulary richness indicates writing style
    - Readability: Sentence complexity affects sentiment expression
    
    Args:
        texts (List[str]): List of text strings
    
    Returns:
        List[Dict[str, float]]: Statistical features for each text
    
    Each dictionary contains:
        - 'word_count': Total number of words
        - 'char_count': Total number of characters (excluding spaces)
        - 'sentence_count': Number of sentences (approximate)
        - 'avg_word_length': Average length of words
        - 'vocab_diversity': Unique words / total words (lexical diversity)
        - 'exclamation_count': Number of exclamation marks
        - 'question_count': Number of question marks
        - 'uppercase_ratio': Proportion of uppercase characters
    
    Examples:
        >>> extract_feature_statistics(["Great movie! Really enjoyed it."])

def build_feature_matrix(texts: List[str], feature_config: Dict[str, bool]) -> Tuple[List[List[float]], List[str]]:
