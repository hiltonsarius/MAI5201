## Summary

### What is most interesting in the paper?

I found it very interesting the way the writer explained in not so technical terms how the program works. Then proceeded to give a more in-depth analysis to show the technical details with the use of data structures such as lists and multidimensional arrays. The use of SLIP (available technology at the time) functions to achieve the goal of program efficiency (efficiently utilize processing time and storage in memory)
The use of a key list that can be represented as a tree diagram is quite elegant. 

### What could the paper have done better?

The way the tree diagram is structured is a bit unclear. The k could have been placed in brackets next to the top node. Then the Ds could have been also placed in brackets next to the nodes. Finally, the Rs do not have nodes. They could have added nodes and then place the Rs in brackets next to the nodes. The section that speaks about “keyword dictionary” and “vector KEY” (Weizenbaum, J. (1966)) was a bit unclear to me and could have been explained with a diagram. Although this paper gives a very good idea of how ELIZA works, I believe the aim to do a complete “unmasking” (Weizenbaum, J. (1966)) was not fully accomplished. And in my opinion, the use of a video walking through how the concepts work would do a better “unmasking”.

### What questions do you have from reading the paper?

It is intriguing that the researchers found best performance when the human correspondents were asked to “talk” to ELIZA as if they were speaking to a psychiatrist. Is that job so easy that a program built in 1960s can perform at a level acceptable to humans? Is there any research about scammers using similar AI tools to automate their social engineering? Typically, today we find scammers targeting the weak and vulnerable. An example of this is shown at the start of the 2024 movie The Beekeeper starring Jason Statham. It would be interesting to see a study about how AI tools are being used to automate and simplify scamming
